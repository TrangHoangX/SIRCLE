			<h1>Welcome to S-IRCLE project</h1>
			
            <br />
            <p>
S-IRCLE project focuses on addressing key challenges in small-scale biogas plants. The primary objective is to develop an innovative, automatic, regenerable external filter system capable of effectively 
removing hydrogen sulfide (H2S) from biogas. This is crucial as H2S poses health risks and can lead to corrosion, reducing the lifespan of biogas appliances. Furthermore, the project aims to recycle sulfur present 
in the loaded filter material as an alternative sulfur fertilizer, promoting sustainable resource utilization.

			<br />
			<br />
Overall, S-IRCLE project encompasses both technical development and environmental evaluation, aiming to contribute to the advancement of biogas technology in Vietnam and pave the way for a more sustainable and efficient biogas utilization.

			<p><strong> Survey on plastic recycling completed</strong></p>
			<i>28/06/2023</i>
			<p> The survey on plastic recycling in Vietnam, conducted by the Hanoi University of Science and Technology, has been completed. The goal of this survey is to provide an overview 
				of the current plastic recycling situation in Vietnam. More than 10 environmental companies of various sizes across Vietnam participated, providing information on plastic 
				waste collection—regarding quantity, classification, and methods, as well as recycling—regarding origin, classification and methods. From the results of the survey, 
				a material flow analysis will be performed to map out and quantify the flow of different types of plastic waste across various stakeholders involved in the process, with a view to assessing environmental 
				impacts such as resource efficiency, greenhouse gas emissions, and human health.

			<i>24/03/2024</i>
			<p>On March 21st, researchers from the Technical University of Berlin and engineer Marcel Spahr from Herbst Umwelttechnik GmbH and the delegation group from ZUG gGmbH – a federal company and 
				specialised project management guided by the German Federal Government visited Hai Hau commune, Nam Dinh province. With the assistance of Egreen Technology Joint Stock Company 
				as well as Hanoi University of Science and Technology, the German partners completed the technical check-up of three small-scale biogas plants installed for H2S gas filtration testing. 
				The test filter not only received positive feedback from the households using it but also impressed the delegation groups. 
				After nearly a year of installation, despite the biogas usage for cooking reaching up to 200m3, the filter consistently ensures that the H2S gas level remains at 0. 
				This visit marks the successful mid-term phase of the project and promises progress

			<p><strong> Pakchoi of the second experiment harvested </strong></p>
			<i>22/12/2023</i>
			<p>On a cold winter day, the 19th of December, the Pakchoi plants have reached their maturity after 60 days and been ready for harvesting. 
				The harvest day followed a similar procedure to that of the first experiment: after thorough preparation, sprout, root and soil samples were collected and dried. 
				The analysis work only starts after the Christmas vacation, during which the samples are either ground to determine the elements presented using ICP method, or extracted for examining the concentration of the soluble elements.

			<p> The Leibniz Institute of Vegetable and Ornamental Crops (IGZ) once again serves as the facilitator for our second experiment, aimed at investigating how plant development is affected by different types of soil mixtures: 
				ordinary earth with FerroSorp and mineral fertilizer, finished compost, or digestate. On October 20th, 25 Pakchoi plants were germinated and transferred to a greenhouse equipped with additional heating lights. They are appropriately watered twice a week, and their height, weight, and leaf count are recorded for further analysis.

				carefully washed, and weighed; soil from each pot was also collected. All the samples were dried appropriately for further analysis. Following the harvest, the lab work phase commences, 
				where various analysis methods and procedures are carried out to examine and draw a conclusion accordingly about different parameters and qualities of plant development using different FerroSorp grain sizes as fertilizers.
